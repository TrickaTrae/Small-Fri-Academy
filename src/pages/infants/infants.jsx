                            We know infants need lots of love and care. Our infant teachers are very well trained to meet the ever changing needs of your infant.
                            Much care is taken on the part of the teachers to learn everything about your little one. Our teachers also take Infant and Toddler training
                            courses, to best meet the needs of your infant. At Small Fri Academy, we let your baby eat when hungry, and sleep when tired. We do not expect
                            infants to be on a schedule. The teachers in our infant rooms have lots of experience working with babies, and we love having the little ones
                            here.
