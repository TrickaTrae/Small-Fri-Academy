                            We transport to neighborhood schools for Kindergarten. We offer Breakfast, Lunch and Snack on site to children, before
                            and after school. We know Kindergarteners are full of energy, and we create a curriculum which provides stimulating,
                            hands on activities, as well as active games to allow the children to use all that energy they have before and after
                            school. We offer summer time field trips to the Kindergarteners when they are out of school.
