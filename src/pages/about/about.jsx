                            Let me start by letting you know that I love working with children. My entire career has been dedicated to the service
                            of children. In college, I earned my Bachelors degree in English, and a second Bachelors degree in Sociology. I continued
                            my education to earn a certification in Criminology and Corrections. During college I worked at the Salt Lake Detention Center
                            Counseling youth, from there I worked in a group home for children with Autism. I then went back to school and earned my Teaching
                            Certificate. With my certificate I had a great time teaching Second, Fifth, and Sixth grade.
                            <br/><br/>
                            While raising a young child, having one on the way, going to school, and working I was faced with the challenge of finding what I
                            considered to be adequate childcare. I searched several facilities in my area, and to my disappointment, I was unable to find a
                            childcare facility that met my expectations. What I have learned through teaching elementary school is that children are
                            born with a natural desire to learn and explore. They thrive on structure and exposure to new and exciting activities. I decided
                            to leave my career of teaching elementary school to create a facility that meets the needs and desires of young children.
                            <br/><br/>
                            I created Small Fri Academy in 1999 to be dedicated to the mental, social, emotional, and physical growth of children. The utmost consideration and
                            preperation is taken in planning a daily schedule that meets the needs of your child. Where ever you do choose to leave your child
                            on a daily basis, ask yourself if you would be willing to spend 10 hours a day, 5 days a week in the same environment you leave your child.
