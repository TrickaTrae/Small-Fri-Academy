                                    Let me start by letting you know that I love working with children. My entire career has been dedicated to the service
                                    of children. In college, I earned my Bachelors degree in English, and a second Bachelors degree in Sociology. I continued
                                    my education to earn a certification in Criminology and Corrections. During college I worked at the Salt Lake Detention Center
                                    Counseling youth, from there I worked in a group home for children with Autism. I then went back to school and earned my Teaching
                                    Certificate. With my certificate I had a great time teaching Second, Fifth, and Sixth grade.<br /><br />
                                    While raising a young child having one on the way, going to school, and working I was faced with the challenge of finding what I
                                    considered to be adequate childcare. I searched several facilities in my area, and to my disappointment, I was unable to find a
                                    childcare facility that met my expectations. What I have learned through teaching elementary school is that children are
                                    born with a natural desire to learn and explore. They thrive on structure and exposure to new and exciting activities. I decided
                                    to leave my career of teaching elementary school to create a facility that meets the needs and desires of young children.<br /><br />
                                    I created Small Fri Academy in 1999 to be dedicated to the mental, social, emotional, and physical growth of children. The utmost consideration and
                                    preperation is taken in planning a daily schedule that meets the needs of your child. Where ever you do choose to leave your child
                                    on a daily basis, ask yourself if you would be willing to spend 10 hours a day, 5 days a week in the same environment you leave your child.

// Brain research has proven that the most influential growing period for the human brain is from birth to about five years of age.
//                                 At this time, millions of brain cells are making connections based on experiences and lots of stimulation. "Children who are denied
//                                 adequate stimulation and learning experiences have brains 40% smaller as adults."(Dr. Bruce Perry) At the age of five, the brain
//                                 starts to get rid of the brain cells that were not stimulated and did not make connections in the earlier years of life. These
//                                 cells can never be replaced again.<br/>
//                                 The care a child recieves from birth to age five is more vital than people realize. Merely feeding a child and changing diapers
//                                 is not enough! "40 percent of children in care, are in care that is destructive to their growth."(Dr Bruce Perry) Research shows
//                                 that children who score the highest on tests are those who had been interacted with in early childhood.
